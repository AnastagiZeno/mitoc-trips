<h2> Lottery Preferences </h2>
<h3>Winter School Lottery</h3>
<p>Due to the large number of Winter School participants and a limited number
of trips, placement for each weekend's trips will be done by lottery.
For more information, see the <a href="{% url 'help-lottery' %}">help pages</a>.</p>

{% if "leaders" in groups %}
<h3> Leaders </h3>
<p> If you're able to drive for your trip (or any of the trips you've signed up
for as a participant), please indicate here. It will help participants get
placed on trips they're interested in.
</p>
{% endif %}

<h3>About ranking trips</h3>

{% if not formset.total_form_count %}
<p>Begin by signing up for any trips you're interested in. You can always
<a href="{% url 'view_trips' %}">browse all available trips</a>.</p>
<p>If you'd like to go on a trip, sign up for it. Once you've signed up for
trips you'd like to go on, they will appear here.</p>
{% else %}
<p>Please rank your trips in the order of preference. Trips with lower
numbers (negatives are valid) are given higher priority over other trips.
For example, you could give your top-choice trip an order value of "1,"
and your second choice a value of "2."</p>
<p>If you do not rank your trips, they will be considered in the order of
signup.</p>
{% endif %}
