<h2><a href="{% url 'view_trip' trip.id %}">{{ trip }}</a>: Trip Emergency Information</h2>

<p>Before departing on your trip, it's imperative that one of the leaders
complete the following form. The responses you give here are very important -
they are automatically relayed to the WIMP, and will be used to coordinate
any search and rescue efforts.</p>

<p>This form becomes available the Friday before your trip, and is available
for editing through the day of your trip.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> If you make any changes to your trip itinerary,
you should return to this page and update the appropriate fields. This will ensure
that the WIMP has the most up-to-date information regarding your trip.</p>
