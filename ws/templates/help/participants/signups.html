<p>Leaders will post trips, along with a brief description to list of trips. Signups for each trip will open at a time given in the &quot;sign up&quot; section of the trip summary.</p>
<p>When signups open, you can sign up with the form that appears below the trip summary. You may only sign up once.</p>

<h4 id="how-do-i-know-if-im-on-the-trip">How do I know if I'm on the trip?</h4>
<p>If the trip was a first-come, first-serve trip, you will immediately be able to see if you made the participant list, or have been placed in the waiting list. If the trip is a lottery trip, you will know once the lottery algorithm has run. For more information, see the lottery section.</p>

<h4 id="what-timezone-are-trip-times-in">What timezone are trip times in?</h4>
