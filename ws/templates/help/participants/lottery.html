<h4 id="what-is-the-lottery-system">What is the lottery system?</h4>
<p>Due to high levels of interest in Winter School trips, we will run a lottery to assign participants to trips. The system prioritizes MIT affiliates, those who have been on fewer trips than their peers, and those who have a strong record of trip attendance.</p>

<h4 id="how-does-the-lottery-work">How does the lottery work?</h4>
<p>After trips are posted on the signup system, participants may sign up for as many trips as they like, until 6 am on Wednesday morning. After signing up for trips, participants should rank trips from most-preferred, to least preferred. The lottery will try to place each participant on their most preferred trip.</p>

<h4 id="what-if-i-dont-submit-lottery-preferences">What if I don't submit lottery preferences?</h4>
<p>You will be treated as a non-driver, and your trip preferences will be taken as the order in which you selected trips.</p>

<h4 id="what-if-im-not-placed-on-a-trip">What if I'm not placed on a trip?</h4>
<p>You will be placed in the waiting list for your top-ranked trip. If you do not get on your top-ranked trip, you will be more likely to get on a trip the following week.</p>

<h4 id="do-drivers-get-priority-over-other-participants">Do drivers get priority over other participants?</h4>
<p>Yes and no. If a trip is full, and a driver has expressed interest in that trip, they can displace the last-added participant, but only if the trip does not have enough drivers. In all other respects, those who own cars or are willing to rent are treated exactly the same as other participants.</p>

<h4 id="what-do-i-do-after-the-lottery-has-run">What do I do after the lottery has run?</h4>
<p>You will be notified of which trip (if any) you've been placed on. Wednesday at noon, all trips will be re-opened for signups under a first-come, first-serve system. If you're pulled from the waiting list, you will be notified and contacted by the trip leader.</p>

<h4 id="what-if-i-want-to-go-on-more-than-one-trip-in-a-weekend">What if I want to go on more than one trip in a weekend?</h4>
<p>The algorithm only attempts to place participants on one trip per weekend. After the lottery has completed, you may sign up for other trips as you wish.</p>

<h4 id="id-only-like-to-go-on-a-trip-if-i-can-go-with-my-friendsignificant-otheretc.">I'd only like to go on a trip if I can go with my friend/significant other/etc.</h4>
<p>You can <a href="{% url 'lottery_pair' %}">specify another participant</a>
that you'd like to go on trips with. When the lottery runs, you will either
both be placed on a trip or be placed on your highest ranked trip's
waitlist.</p>
