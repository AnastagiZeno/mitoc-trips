<h2 id="about">About this project</h2>
<p>This site was created in 2014 to improve MITOC's Winter School program.
It has since evolved into the central portal for all MITOC trips.</p>

<h3>History</h3>
<p>
Once upon a time, Winter School trips operated on a first-come, first-serve
basis. Signups opened at noon, and filled up extremely quickly. Many
participants found themselves unable to attend any trips in a given weekend,
and others struggled to gain exposure to new activities.
</p>

<p>
We introduced a lottery system to combat the &quot;fastest gun in the
West&quot; problem. Instead of rewarding trip slots to whomever could sign up
the fastest, we used an equitable algorithm to distribute trip slots. As a
result of this new algorithm, we saw unprecedented levels of participation.
Everyone who expressed interest in attending weekend trips was placed on a
trip, and popular activities like ice climbing were more accessible.
</p>

<h3>Present</h3>
<p>
Today, all MITOC trips are organized through this portal. Many trips are
first-come, first-serve, but we use lottery-based signups for other popular
trip formats once subject to same problems as Winter School.
</p>

<h3>Technology</h3>
<p>The site is powered by PostgreSQL, Django, and Angular. It formerly ran on SIPB's
<a href="https://scripts.mit.edu/">Scripts</a> service, but has since been
migrated to Amazon Web Services.<p>

<p>The code that drives this service is <a href="https://github.com/DavidCain/mitoc-trips">open source</a>. Feature requests, comments, and pull requests are welcome!</p>
