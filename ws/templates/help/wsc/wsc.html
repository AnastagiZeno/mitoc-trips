<h4 id="trip_approval">How does does the WSC approve trips?</h4>
<p>To mark a trip as approved, use the <a href="{% url 'manage_trips' %}">trip management interface</a>. Simply tick each
trip as approved, and click submit.</p>

<h4 id="trip_approval">How do trips lose approval?</h4>
<p>If trip leaders edit the trip itself, they will lose its approval. Leaders are
given a warning about this behavior if their trip is already approved.</p>

<p>
Previously approved trips lose their approval when:
<ul>
    <li>A trip leader edits any field of the trip. This includes the leader list, trip date, description, etc.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Trips do <em>not</em> lose approval if:
<ul>
    <li>An admin or WSC member edits the trip</li>
    <li>Leaders submit or modify trip itinerary</li>
    <li>The participant list changes for any reason</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4 id="lecture_attendance">How do we record lecture attendance?</h4>
<p>Lecture attendance can always be manually set for any participant on the
<a href="{% url 'manage_participants' %}">manage participants</a> page.</p>
<p>A <a href="{% url 'lecture_attendance' %}">special page</a> exists that allows
participants to enter their login information and be marked as having attended
lectures. Note that this does not actually log in the participants. The page
is only viewable to the WSC - committee members are encouraged to bring laptops
to lecture for sign-in. Alternatively, an admin can temporarily alter
permissions to allow any participant to view the page.
</p>

<h4 id="wimp">How is the WIMP specified?</h4>
<p> A comprehensive <a href="{% url 'wimp' %}">sheet for the WIMP</a> is
available at any time. It lists all the emergency information for all upcoming
trips. This page is viewable only to members of the WSC and designated WIMPs.
To specify a WIMP for a given week, have an admin add the participant to the
WIMP group.</p>
