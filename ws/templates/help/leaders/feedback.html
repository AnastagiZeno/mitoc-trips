<h4 id="how-do-i-view-a-participants-past-feedback">How do I view a participant's past feedback?</h4>
<p>When administrating your trip, a short summary of a participant's past feedback will appear in the signup table. For more detailed information, including the leader supplying the feedback, and the relevant trip, see the participant's summary page (click their name in the table).</p>

<h4 id="how-do-i-submit-feedback">How do I submit feedback?</h4>
<p>After your trip has completed, go to its review page. You will see a table with a form for each participant. Fill them all out, then hit &quot;submit.&quot; You're done! Additionally, the system will remind you if you haven't submitted feedback for a trip yet.</p>

<h4 id="what-should-i-put-in-feedback">What should I put in feedback?</h4>
<p>The feedback feature is designed to help other leaders gauge a participant's abilities and fitness for future trips. Accordingly, please specify anything that would be useful to future leaders. This may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical fitness, general demeanor</li>
<li>Level of preparedness</li>
<li>Whether or not the participant showed up (please check the box)</li>
</ul>
<p>By indicating that a participant did not show up for your trip, you are helping more reliable participants to get placed on trips over &quot;flaky&quot; participants.</p>

<h4 id="how-do-i-keep-my-feedback-anonymous">How do I keep my feedback anonymous?</h4>
<p>When you supply feedback for a participant, simply check the box &quot;Prefer to remain anonymous&quot; to keep your comments anonymous. The database will still store identifying information, such as the time the comments were created, the supplying leader, and the trip, but all this information will be hidden from other leaders.</p>
