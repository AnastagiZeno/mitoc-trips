          We search for a current MITOC membership under any of your verified
          email addresses. If we find a matching membership, we tie that to your
          account.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you think you're a current member, but don't see yourself as
          active here, you've most likely signed up for a membership under
          another email address. Make sure that you add and verify any email
          address that you may have signed up with.

        <h5>Why isn't my waiver showing up?</h5>
        <p>
          First, ensure you <a href="https://rightsignature.com/forms/Liability-Waiver--97a3de/token/39c17d4086f">signed the waiver</a>
          under the same email address as your membership:
          <span data-ng-bind="::membership.email"></span>.
        </p>

        <h5>But I'm positive that my account is under one of these email addresses!</h5>

          Sometimes our system can be a little slow to update. If it's been at least 24
          hours since you paid your membership dues and/or signed a waiver,
